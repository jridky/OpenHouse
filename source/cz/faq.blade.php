                array("q" => "What is a talk?", "a" => "<strong>A talk</strong> is where you talk using slides and demos to an audience that listens. A talk is  either <strong>20 or 40 minutes long</strong>, make sure you reserve time at the end for Q&A. If speakers wish to continue with the <strong>Q&A</strong> after their time slot, there will be a dedicated place for it.  Feel free to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in chat while you are talking. A talk has one primary speaker, optionally another (secondary) speaker.</p><p><strong>A talk should be bite-sized and focused</strong> on a certain topic. This means that you should not expect to be able to cover multiple broad areas in one talk. You can submit more than one proposal, to cover a set of topics, but we cannot guarantee their final scheduled order. Therefore, we recommend topics be structured in a way so as to minimize their interdependence so that they do not need to be presented in a specific order.</p><p>We give speakers <strong>a choice to speak live or send us a pre-recorded session</strong>. We understand pre-recording your session requires extra time and extra set of skills and we are currently considering ways to make it easier for you. If you choose to pre-record your session, remember it only needs to be as good as you would do live. This is not a Hollywood movie :)"),

It is more interactive than a talk because you could engage with the audience during the session. If you are willing to open the discussion to attendees, consider holding a fishbowl discussion where you start with a group of speakers and an empty “seat” which could be filled by active audience members in the course of a discussion.</p><p>A discussion is <strong>40 minutes long</strong>. If speakers wish to continue after the 40-minute slot, there will be a dedicated place for it. A discussion has a dedicated moderator and <strong>up to 5 active speakers</strong>.</p><p>Discussions are <strong>delivered live</strong>. We do not accept pre-recorded discussions."),

The goal of a workshop is to teach or practice a skill. You should not expect the audience following each step of the worksop live, however, they should have all necessary instructions if they wish to. As a result workshops should be actionable and goal oriented.</p><p>A workshop is <strong>40 minutes long</strong>, although we will consider exceptions. The number of attendees is not limited like it would be in an in-person event.</p><p>We allow <strong>up to 3 active presenters</strong> in a workshop. You must designate one of them to be the primary session leader. Feel free to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in chat while you are talking.</p><p>All workshops are <strong>conducted live</strong>. We do not accept pre-recorded workshops. However, you may find it <strong>useful to pre-record demo components</strong> of your workshop."),

We are working on a list of suggestions for virtual booths and meetups. We are open to working together with booth staff and meetup organizers in order to find the best possible solution in the virtual environment.</p><p><strong>Contests</strong> are easy to set up, there should be an intro meeting for those who want to join and then they can work on their own. We will provide a chat channel to help and monitor the contest."),

The goal of the lightning talk is to convey key information in a clear and concise manner. You can talk about the things that excite you, challenges you overcome, issues you did not overcome and what you learned from it, insights to your work that you wish someone told you before you started.</p><p>A lightning talk is 5-minute long. All lightning talks are pre-recorded and submitted in advance.</p><p>Lightning talks will be available to view during the whole event. The voting for the best talk will be available too and 3 best talks will be announced the last day.")

The coach will contact the apprentice prior to the conference to arrange a virtual meeting prior to attending the conference via a video conference (BlueJeans, Talky.io, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, etc) or a voice call. This meeting will give you a chance to exchange introductions, answer any questions the apprentice has as they prepare to attend the conference, learn about the apprentice's career goals, review the conference schedule together, and plan to attend some sessions together. During the conference, you will be invited to meet other apprentices and coaches. The coaching includes helping show apprentices how to participate in the virtual conference."),
