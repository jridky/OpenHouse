			<p>To have the best possible experience at DevConf.CZ 2021 we have prepared the following checklist for you to prepare beforehand. Take a

			<p>Be sure that you're registered for DevConf.CZ 2021 at Hopin as a speaker. If there is a message with <i>"You're in!"</i> at the beginning of the subject that means you are.

			<p>Try to connect with a minimum of <b>5Mbit/s</b> download and <b>2Mbit/s</b> upload speed. The higher upload and download speeds will offer a better experience, ideally <b>30Mbit/s</b> download and <b>10Mbit/s</b>
			 upload speed. Try limiting other consumers of your Internet capacity, e.g. try running software updates a day before to prevent them from running during the conference, pause or stop any large downloads, 
			 if need be disconnect other devices from your network. Using a <b>physical</b> cable connection is recommended. You can check your Internet speed by using an online network speed test website, search for 
			 Internet speed test in the web search engine of your choice.</p>

		<div class="h4 pt-3 pb-4 mx-5 mont-700 w-100">Audio and Video</div>

		<div class="os-400 mx-5">
			<p>Here is a list of recommendations for the best experience with audio and video during the conference:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>You are not able to share audio/video by default. All speakers and attendees can request to share their audio and video. The session chair will then grant you access.</li>
			    <li>To maximize speaker video or presentation video double click on that video stream, this will enlarge that portion of the video stream.</li>
			    <li>Play audio using headphones, this will help in understanding the speaker, and prevent any audio feedback.</li>
			    <li>If you have multiple input video/audio sources, be sure you set proper one.</li>

			<p>As a speaker please take into consideration the points mentioned above, and also in addition to that the following.</p>

		<div class="h4 pt-3 pb-4 mx-5 mont-700 w-100">Conference support on Hopin and Discord</div>

		<div class="os-400 mx-5">
			<p>Once in the hopin platform, as a speaker, you can access the Green Room and test your audio/video setup and slide sharing before your session starts. If you experience any issues, 
			we will be providing support in the same room.</p>
			<p>As a speaker access the <a href="https://discord.gg/devconf" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> and set up your account. We will be providing support on the #speakers channel.</p>

		<div class="h4 pt-3 pb-4 mx-5 mont-700 w-100">For your session</div>

		<div class="os-400 mx-5">
			<p>Please join the session 10 minutes before the scheduled time to connect with the session chair and prepare your slides, audio, and video setup. The same applies to pre-recorded 
			sessions, we ask you to be present during the stream and interact with the audience. Note that all live sessions are recorded, and will be shared on YouTube afterwards.</p>
		</div>

<section id="screen" class="mx-auto col-lg-11">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="h4 pt-3 pb-4 mx-5 mont-700 w-100">Sharing screen</div>

		<div class="os-400 mx-5">
			<p>When you enter the session ask for permission to share your audio/video during the break. Once you are granted access, you can control screen sharing using the monitor icon in the row with 
			four buttons along the bottom. If the icon is crossed with a red line that means you're not sharing your screen, click on the icon to start sharing.</p>
			<p>On Linux desktops using Wayland sharing the screen in Firefox is somewhat involved. You might need to confirm twice what part of the screen you want to share.</p>
			<p>Similarly using Chrome (or Chromium) on Linux desktop using Wayland sharing the whole screen might end up exposing a completely black screen. In that case, make sure that you're 
			sharing the window of a single application or single tab within Chrome.</p>
			<p>On Mac, you may have to alter security preferences to allow screen sharing. <b>If you are not able to share</b>, look under SystemPreferences &rarr; Security &amp; Privacy &rarr; Screen Recording.
			 Click on Google Chrome to enable sharing application windows. Please note <b>changing the settings will close Google Chrome and you will need to open the browser again and rejoin the Hopin session</b>.</p>

		<div class="os-400 mx-5">
			<p>As you play sounds from videos or as a part of the presentation your operating system to prevent feedback will block that audio from the microphone. To succeed in playing audio as 
			a part of the presentation have a look at the solutions documented at Hopin support page on <a href="https://support.hopin.to/en/articles/4277212-sharing-computer-audio-during-an-event" target="_blank">Sharing
