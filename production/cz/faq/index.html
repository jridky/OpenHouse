						<strong>A talk</strong> is where you talk using slides and demos to an audience that listens. A talk is  either <strong>20 or 40 minutes long</strong>, make sure you reserve time at the end for Q&A. If speakers wish to continue with the <strong>Q&A</strong> after their time slot, there will be a dedicated place for it.  Feel free to recruit your colleagues to interact with people in chat while you are talking. A talk has one primary speaker, optionally another (secondary) speaker.</p><p><strong>A talk should be bite-sized and focused</strong> on a certain topic. This means that you should not expect to be able to cover multiple broad areas in one talk. You can submit more than one proposal, to cover a set of topics, but we cannot guarantee their final scheduled order. Therefore, we recommend topics be structured in a way so as to minimize their interdependence so that they do not need to be presented in a specific order.</p><p>We give speakers <strong>a choice to speak live or send us a pre-recorded session</strong>. We understand pre-recording your session requires extra time and extra set of skills and we are currently considering ways to make it easier for you. If you choose to pre-record your session, remember it only needs to be as good as you would do live. This is not a Hollywood movie :)					</div>

						<strong>A discussion</strong> is a bit where <strong>you lead/moderate a discussion with a group of knowledgeable panelists</strong> where they answer prepared questions or questions from the audience as selected by you for appropriateness to your topic and session’s goal. It is more interactive than a talk because you could engage with the audience during the session. If you are willing to open the discussion to attendees, consider holding a fishbowl discussion where you start with a group of speakers and an empty “seat” which could be filled by active audience members in the course of a discussion.</p><p>A discussion is <strong>40 minutes long</strong>.

						<strong>A workshop is a hands-on demo</strong> where you and other workshop leads interact among each other and with audience members on chat, sharing your knowledge and experience on a particular bite-sized topic. The goal of a workshop is to teach or practice a skill. You should not expect the audience following each step of the worksop live, however, they should have all necessary instructions if they wish to. As a result workshops should be actionable and goal oriented.</p><p>A workshop is <strong>40 minutes long</strong>, although we will consider exceptions.

We have a <a href='/cz/speakerguide/' target='_blank'>speaker guide</a> and a <a href='/cz/speakercoachingguide' target='_blank'>speaker coaching guide</a> available to support speakers and coaches. People who sign up, will receive their coaching matches by December 18, with the expectation that they will schedule practice sessions between January 4 and January 15.<br><br>We ask the coaches to take the lead on scheduling the practice session via a video conference (BlueJeans, Talky.io, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, etc). The speaker can choose to invite other audience members to the practice.

						Yes! When you register for the event, you will be asked whether you would like to be a coach or an apprentice and what topics you have experience in or are interested in. Coaches and apprentices will then receive their matches via email. We always get a lot of interest from people to be coached, and encourage people who have attended more than ten technology conferences to sign up as coaches. If you have attended fewer than three technology conferences, please consider signing up as an apprentice.					</div>

						Apprentices will be paired with coaches, with our best efforts being made to pair apprentices with coaches who have experience with one or more of the technical topics apprentices selected a preference for when registering. The coach will contact the apprentice prior to the conference to arrange a virtual meeting prior to attending the conference via a video conference (BlueJeans, Talky.io, Jitsi Meet, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, etc) or a voice call. This meeting will give you a chance to exchange introductions, answer any questions the apprentice has as they prepare to attend the conference, learn about the apprentice's career goals, review the conference schedule together, and plan to attend some sessions together. During the conference, you will be invited to meet other apprentices and coaches. The coaching includes helping show apprentices how to participate in the virtual conference.					</div>

						In past years, we've offered diversity scholarships and coaching for new speakers. We'll be offering programs for our virtual event as well. We will pair coaches with new speakers to help with presentation content as well as video production. This option will be available on the acceptance notification. More details on this and other efforts will be added to our site in the near future.					</div>
